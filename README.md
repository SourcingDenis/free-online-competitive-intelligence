<h1>🔎 40+ open source intelligence tools for various internet investigations</h1>
<p>Rather than go into how you do online competitive intelligence, I&rsquo;m just going to run through a free list of tools that have earned themselves and honorable mention here and give you some awesome tidbits for finding information online.</p>
<p>I review competitive information on a daily basis; I have to warn you that its a lot of information.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of simply sitting down and playing with one or two tools a week and seeing what you come up with. The real magic begins to happen when you start discovering that one tool provides the secret ingredient to turbo-charge the next tool.</p>
<h2>Every tool on this list is free&nbsp;🌟<span id="more-8903"></span></h2>
<p>(some of them may have premium paid upgrades, but they aren&rsquo;t necessarily required.)</p>
<p>If you would like to find out about the how and why behind using these tools, check out my&nbsp;<a title="competitive intelligence" href="http://barryhurd.com/tag/competitive-intelligence/">competitive intelligence</a>&nbsp;posts.</p>
<h3><strong>Google Tools</strong></h3>
<p>You can&rsquo;t beat Google when it comes to free information and tons of data. The biggest issue with using Google effectively is understanding how to sift through massive volumes of data to find actionable nuggets of wisdom. To help you do that I&rsquo;ve include two link to a advanced search parameter cheat sheet and a walk-through of using advanced parameters. If you have a few minutes, you can also watch this official&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/landing/powersearching.html">Google training video on advanced search parameters</a>.</p>
